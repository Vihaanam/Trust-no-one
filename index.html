            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <br>
            <h3><b>H</b>ill tower, the home of a once living knight. Now in ruins. For decades it had been empty, not even ants in it.
            Now it wouldn't be so...</h3>
            <h3>Hector Will, the person who cleans up buildings and houses with his army of machinery and some people.
            was given the job of cleaning it up. And so our story starts...</h3>
            <h3>"Hector!" It was Tyson. His brother. "Yeah! Coming!"</h3>
            <h3>"Today we will be selling lots of objects. The person was a knight. Valuable pieces of art."</h3>
            <h3>"I know. The best offer we have ever had. Inform the others. They know the address. Or maybe not. That place is in some mix of a desert and a forest."</h3>
            <h3>"We will leave today."</h3>
            <h3>"I will take out my bike. My special four seater."</h3>
            <h3>"Let the others come."</h3>
            <h3>After an hour Jeremy James and then later Henry entered the door.</h3>
            <h3>Hector was confused. "Henry, why are you carrying a helmet?"</h3>
            <h3>"I also have a double layered protective jacket, socks and a pair of trousers. It is 'Mosquito Protection'. You informed me there were going to be mosquitos."</h3>
            <h3>"Er..."</h3>
            <h3>"Let's leave," said Jeremy.</h3>
            <h3>"Okay."</h3>
            <h3>And they walked out.</h3>
            <h3>"Let me wear my helmet," said Henry.</h3>
            <h3>"We all are wearing them, but not 'Mosquito Protection' ones."</h3>
            <h3>"Okay. Ready."</h3>
            <h3>But Tyson was sure to say, "The bike is to your right."</h3>
            <h3>"Oh! Er... Aargh!"</h3>
            <h3>"Henry, you fell."</h3>
            <h3>Suddenly, the bike started. Taking Henry with it.</h3>
            <h3>"Henry! Take your hand off the accelerator!" It was Hector.</h3>
            <h3>"I can't see a thing!"</h3>
            <h3>"Your hands are on the handles!"</h3>
            <h3>"Okay!"</h3>
            <h3>He took his hands off the handles and the bike skided to the left. "Whoah!" And he kept them again. The bike balanced and he couldn't be seen.</h3>
            <h3>"My bike!"</h3>
            <h3>Tyson said, "Let's call him." And so Jeremy did. Henry answered it and then there was a crash. CRASH!</h3>
            <h3>"Why did you call me!" It was Henry without his helmet, seeing everything fine.</h3>
            <h3>"Are you okay?"</h3>
            <h3>"Yes! Thanks to Mosquito Protection."</h3>
            <h3>"My bike!"</h3>
            <h3>"I will come there. There really are mosquitos. Let me wear my helmet."</h3>
            <h3>Hector snatched the cellphone from Jeremy when Tyson whispered, "Didn't you think the helmet was dusty?".</h3>
            <h3>"Henry, no!" But Henry stopped the call. After a while, they saw Henry running towards them.</h3>
            <h3>"He'll come."</h3>
            <h3>"Why isn't he stopping?"</h3>
            <h3>"I have no idea."</h3>
            <h3>"He is still not."</h3>
            <h3>"Yes."</h3>
            <h3>"He is running very fast."</h3>
            <h3>"I don't think he will stop!"</h3>
            <h3>"Yes!"</h3>
            <h3>"RUN!"</h3>
            <h3>And they were soon running away from Henry. Who had no idea but was about to crash with them. He removed his helmet but couldn't stop himself. Meanwhile, the others met a dead end, a cliff. And Henry sent them and himself down the cliff. All were holding onto the rock above them.</h3>
            <h3>"Henry! Look what you did!" said Jeremy. And he slowly reached the top of the cliff.</h3>
            <h3>The other three saw something under them. A spider.</h3>
            <h3>"Nothing to worry, just a Goliath."</h3>
            <h3>But Tyson who was scared of spiders jumped and left himself holding Hector's shoe.</h3>
            <h3>Slowly, Henry climbed up. Tyson however, was making it hard for Hector to.</h3>
            <h3>"My leg! You are twisting my ankle!"</h3>
            <h3>"Sorry!"</h3>
            <h3>With some help from Jeremy and Henry, they made their way up.</h3>
            <h3>"I think I sprained my ankle. Ouch!"</h3>
            <h3>Jeremy questioned, "How will we reach there?"</h3>
            <h3>Tyson said, "We will have to walk."</h3>
            <h3>"But my bike!"</h3>
            <h3>"Well, the sold objects are useful."</h3>
            <h3>"Yes."</h3>
            <h3>Henry said, "I have got four cycles."</h3>
            <h3>"I will rather walk."</h3>
            <h3>"Okay. We will use them."</h3>
            <h3>They travelled on their cycles, until, of course, they accidentaly rode over a patch of hard rock causing the tyres to puncture.</h3>
            <h3>"Not again!"</h3>
            <h3>"I told you walking was better."</h3>
            <h3>"At this amount of stamina left and very less water supply and, also, my sprained ankle, we will be going at the speed of a snail," said Hector, highly emphasizing on the also.</h3>
            <h3>"We will at least reach."</h3>
            <h3>And they did, at night. <b>Full moon night.</b></h3>
            <h3>"This castle is creepy," stated Tyson.</h3>
            <h3>"Because it is night."</h3>
            <h3>It was creepy. With cobwebs but no spiders, luckily for Tyson.</h3>
            <h3>"Hello!"</h3>
            <h3>"Please don't speak without saying who it is," said Hector.</h3>
            <h3>"Who spoke-"</h3>
            <h3>"Me, Gideon saying, 'Hello'!"</h3>
            <h3>"Yes, Gideon... Wait- who Gideon?"</h3>
            <h3>"Behind you!"</h3>
            <h3>"Where er... behind?"</h3>
            <h3>"Yes!"</h3>
            <h3>And the four turned around.</h3>
            <h3>"I am Gideon," introduced Gideon.</h3>
            <h3>"What are you doing here?"</h3>
            <h3>"Shifting things."</h3>
            <h3>"That is <b>our</b> job.</h3>
            <h3>"So is it mine."</h3>
            <h3>"We'll not help. I need my bike!"</h3>
            <h3>"I'll help."</h3>
            <h3>"Oh, really?" said Jeremy, definitely not believing Gideon.</h3>
            <h3>"I am not doing this search for bikes."</h3>
            <h3>"So aren't we. We are doing it for valuable pieces of art, to sell them, and unusually, buy Hector a new four seater bike."</h3>
            <h3>"Then hear this, this place is full of all valuable things, anything you find, it is valuable. Even the doorknob is made of old rusted iron, valuable because it is old and belonged to a knight."</h3>
            <h3>"Great, I am ready!" said Henry.</h3>
            <h3>"Not sure but okay."</h3>
            <h3>"Okay, hold this," said Gideon handing a medium sized statue to Tyson. "The rest of you, go ahead."</h3>
            <h3>As they turned around, they heard a scream. "Aaaaaargh!"</h3>
            <h3>"Tyson!"</h3>
            <h3>Hector came back and saw Tyson holding his hand and lying on the ground and no Gideon.</h3>
            <h3>"My hand!"</h3>
            <h3>"What happened?"</h3>
            <h3>"Something suddenly pushed into my hand."</h3>
            <h3>"Must have been an ant."</h3>
            <h3>"You just described this place as 'not even ants in it'."</h3>
            <h3>"No, really there are. I saw them. They are giant ants of an unknown species. I asked Jeremy. This is perhaps the only place where they are found."</h3>
            <h3>"Fake description!"</h3>
            <h3>"But where is Gideon?"</h3>
            <h3>"He was there for one second and the next, he is not!"</h3>
            <h3>Henry joined the conversation. "I think there is something wrong with this place."</h3>
            <h3>"Yes, before anything else happens, we should run!"</h3>
            <h3>"Yes!"</h3>
            <h3>They ran away from the palace. The only thing audible from the palace was a laugh coming from each and every corner.</h3>
            <h3>They actually reached home the next day, at noon.</h3>

            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <br>
            <h3><b>M</b>r. Markson was the person to which the four were to give the artifact. Mr. Markson was an angry man. That was all to say about him.</h3>
            <h3>His full name was Markson M. Markson. He thought himself to be so important that he covered his office's door with multiple 'Markson M. Markson' labels so that you thought his name was Markson M. Markson Markson M. Markson Markson M. Markson Markson M. Markson and so on.</h3>
            <h3>He was also known for not taking someone's artifact for all kinds of spurious reasons. Entering through the door one second late...</h3>
            <h3>"You're one second late! I am a busy man. Do you think I will afford to take artifacts from people who are not at all punctual?"</h3>
            <h3>"But sir, there was traffic."</h3>
            <h3>"A common reason. Out!"</h3>
            <h3>Entering through the door a second early...</h3>
            <h3>"You're one second early! I have to spend my entire day looking at artifacts. When will I look at the previous person's artifact? I give everyone 10 minutes. You can't stay for ten minutes and a second."</h3>
            <h3>"Well, I say it is better early than late."</h3>
            <h3>"I don't care what you say! Out!"</h3>
            <h3>Sneezing in the room...</h3>
            <h3>"Achoooo!"</h3>
            <h3>"Stop sneezing! I won't risk the cleanliness of my room for nothing."</h3>
            <h3>"But sir, I have a serious cold."</h3>
            <h3>"Then go and visit the doctor. Out!"</h3>
            <h3>In certain situations, he would even fine you. Dropping an artifact...</h3>
            <h3>"You dropped it! You're lucky if it doesn't crack."</h3>
            <h3>"But it is a very good one."</h3>
            <h3>"Let me see. Yes, it will be worth a million, but now that you have dropped it you will have to pay me half a million, or you will get half a million.</h3>
            <h3>"Better getting half the price than giving it."</h3>
            <h3>"Till then, go out!"</h3>
            <h3>Placing an artifact on the wrong side of the table...</h3>
            <h3>"Not there! Here. If there had been something over there, it would have broken!"</h3>
            <h3>"Sorry sir."</h3>
            <h3>"Give me half a million and leave!"</h3>
            <h3>In short, Mr. Markson was very angry and for once, it was nobody's fault!</h3>
            <h3>When Mr. Markson was young (if he ever was), he liked artifacts a lot. He even went to the artifact showcase, which displayed the same artifacts every day. Even the presenter got bored and stopped coming there.
                 He was the only person who had visited that place in 2 years!</h3>
            <h3>One day, he was holding a piece of bread. Suddenly, something headed straight for him. Looking at how still it was, he thought it was an artifact. He held out his hands to catch it. But, what he failed to see was that it was a bird
                 coming for the bread. The bird swiped the bread and Mr. Markson cut his hand in this proccess. From then onwards, he had a deeply mistrusted anyone with artifacts, even though that was his job.</h3>
